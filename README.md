# The Mocoma fast and easy-to-use HTTP receiver/sender or whatever you want to call it

Basically this lets you send and receive HTTP requests from the URL you provide
supports all methods and all the headers you want.

I use this basically to test my servers but feel free to use it for whatever you want, your welcome.
